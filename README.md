# Mutational signatures correlate with transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 variants and discriminate evolving subtypes in Chile

This is the code repository to reproduce the figures and analysis from our "Mutational signatures correlate with transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 variants and discriminate evolving subtypes in Chile" publication. 

## Running the scripts

ToDo: cleanup a bit and create one script with our main model.


## Notes

The herein presented code relies on our toolbox for [Bayesian python toolbox for inference and forecast of the spread of the Coronavirus](https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference/tree/v0.3.1). If you want to run our code make sure to install the toolbox or to initialize the github submodule.
